Repeat Macro
=========================

A Sublime text 2 and 3 plugin to repeat macro multiple times or till end of file.

Coming from Notepad++(circa 2011) it was really frustrating when I had to hold down on the repeat macro shortcut combination instead of just having it repeat itself. So wrote this plugin on a late night and saved me n others lot of keystrokes. Why? Because we've all got very less [keystores left](http://keysleft.com/)

Definitely open to suggestions and ideas to improve this :)
