Repeat Macro
=============

A Sublime text 2 plugin to repeat macro multiple times.

Coming from Notepad++ it was really frustrating when I had to hold down on the repeat macro shortcut combination instead of just having it repeat itself. So got this ready in < 10 lines of coding, saving developers from hair loss due to frustration :)


Shortcut keys:
* On windows & linux ctrl+alt+shift+r
* On mac cmd+shift+r

Definitely open to suggestions and ideas to improve this :)


Installation:
-------------
In case you haven't setup sublime package control before here's the official page - http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control 

This plugin is now available officially through the sublime package control. Search for 'Repeat Macro' and install it.
